Programmer Notes - CareCloud appointments

app/assets/javascripts/appointment.js.coffee
        In this class I demonstrate two JSON management techniques, 
        used to handle the create and update functions.  Normally,
        I would choose the approach employed in processErrorMessage
        as a default, but in some cases we may need to retrieve the
        answer from the server, parse and present.  The commented out
        line
        #$("#msgbox_txt").append json_obj.notice + "<br />" + json_obj.status + "<br />" + json_obj.object
        shows the parsed JSON object options available.

        The remove_tags function is used to handle the visual effect
        that is triggered when the 'Delete' appointment tag is clicked.

app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb
        index
                Setup index requests based on start_time, first_name
                or a default to display all options.

        create, update, destroy
                Setup JSON response handling for AJAX submissions.
                On create respond with JSON feed the created object, status
                and a success message
                On update response with just the JSON message, should include
                the status code outside of the JSON response, in the same manner
                as create.
                on Destroy, don't respond, since on the default setup the user
                confirms to delete and expects the item to visually dissapper
                when the action is requested, the delete handling is done
                with JQuery.

app/models/appointment.rb
        Setup validations for the date varibles, to check that the dates are valid      
        and that there are no time conflicts with other dates.

app/views/appointments
         _form partial
                On the experimental branch replace the datetime_select with regular
                text field and a class to map the datetimepicker.

         On the rest of the views change the form submit tags to remote mode, for Ajax handling.
